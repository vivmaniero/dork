This repository /currently/ acts as a backup for a [[https://vm.grtcdr.tn][short and sweet org table formula]] I wrote a little while ago, it helps me calculate the total average of all my courses.

This is targeted towards students of ESPRIT and users of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]].

Do they ring a bell? -- No? Go on and check them out then, [[https://emacsrocks.com/][they're very powerful]].

* Notice

[[file:lisp/dork.el][dork.el]] is pre-alpha software, it is under heavy development, and is
subject to change in significant ways, so hold your horses!

[[file:documentation/dork.org][dork.org]] although usable, will transition to use the internal
functions offered by dork.el, as soon as the development phase is over
-- it will however remain unaffected during this period.

* FAQ
** "Why Elisp?"
Beneath Emacs lies a very powerful programming language.

As soon as Emacs had begun to grow on me, I noticed a trend -- one that
had me transition my tasks, which I previously used to perform within
my shell, in the comfort of the command-line, to a new, yet equally
coherent environment -- /Emacs/.

I am now a relatively intermediate user of Emacs, and I have slowly
but steadily overcome the fear of Elisp, recognizing it as the
electricity that powers my artificial home.
** "Why not JavaScript?"
I've seen the solutions written by other students. They're mediocre,
to say the least.

The mediocrity of such solutions is not a consequence of the lack of
skills of their authors, far from it, actually. It's simply because
the website which students are forced to go through is, to put it
bluntly, a flaming bag of shit.

It doesn't respect today's standards that qualify it as a decent web
portal. Hell, it doesn't even respect a single standard set two
decades ago, when the internet and web technologies were still at
their infancy.
** "Why not Excel?"
I tend to avoid heavy software such as the Microsoft Office suite.

Further, I don't find much joy investing lots of time in learning
closed source technologies -- and aeons upon aeons perfecting them, nor
do intend to shell out tens of dollars annually for what I can do
gratis.
