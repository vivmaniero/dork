This repository /currently/ acts as a backup for a [[file:dork.org][really neat org
table formula]] I wrote a little while ago, one that calculates the
total average of all my courses.

This is targeted towards students of ESPRIT and users of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]].

Do they ring a bell? No, go on and check them out, [[https://emacsrocks.com/][they're very powerful]].

* Notice

[[file:dork.el][dork.el]] is pre-alpha software, it is under heavy development, and is
subject to change in significant ways, so hold your horses!

[[file:dork.org][dork.org]] although usable, will transition to use the internal
functions offered by dork.el, as soon as the development phase is over
-- it will however remain unaffected during this period.

* Questions No One Asked
** "Why Elisp?"
Beneath Emacs lies a very powerful programming language.

As soon as Emacs had begun to grow on me, I noticed a trend -- one that
had me transition my tasks, which I previously used to perform within
my shell, in the comfort of the command-line, to a new, yet equally
coherent environment -- /Emacs/.

I am now a relatively intermediate user of Emacs, and I have slowly
but steadily overcome the fear of Elisp, recognizing it as the
electricity that powers my artificial home.
** "Why not JavaScript?"
I've seen the solutions written by other students. They're mediocre,
to say the least.

The mediocrity of such solutions is not a consequence of the lack of
skills of their authors, far from it, actually. It's simply due to the
fact the website which students are forced to go through, is quite
honestly, a piece of shit.

It doesn't respect today's standards that qualify it as a decent web
portal. Hell, it doesn't even respect a single standard set two
decades ago, when the internet and web technologies were still at
their infancy.
** "Why not Excel?"
I tend to avoid heavy software such as the Microsoft Office suite.

Further, I don't find much joy investing lots of time in learning
closed source technologies -- and aeons upon aeons perfecting them, nor
do intend to shell out tens of dollars annually for what I can do
gratis.
