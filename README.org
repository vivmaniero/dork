#+TITLE: Dork

[[file:images/dork.jpg]]

This repository /currently/ acts as a backup for a [[file:dork.org][really neat org
table formula]] I wrote a little while ago, one that calculates the
total average of all your classes.

This is targeted towards users of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]].

Does that ring a bell? No, go on and check them out, they're very
powerful.

* Notice

[[file:dork.el][dork.el]] is pre-alpha software, it is under heavy development, and is
subject to change in significant ways, so hold your horses!

[[file:dork.org][dork.org]] although usable, will transition to use the internal
functions offered by dork.el, as soon as the development phase is over
-- it will however remain unaffected during this period.

* Questions No One Asked
** "Why Elisp?"
Beneath Emacs lies a very powerful programming language.

As soon as Emacs had begun to grow on me, I noticed a trend -- one that
had me transition my tasks, which I previously used to perform within
my shell, in the comfort of the command-line, to a new, yet equally
coherent environment -- /Emacs/.

I am now a relatively intermediate user of Emacs, and I have slowly
but steadily overcome the fear of Elisp, recognizing it as the
electricity that powers my artificial home.
** "Why not JavaScript?"
I've seen the solutions written by other students. They're mediocre,
to say the least.
** "Why not Excel?"
I tend to avoid heavy software such as the Microsoft Office suite.

Further, I don't find much joy investing lots of time in learning
closed source technologies -- and aeons upon aeons perfecting them, nor
do intend to shell out tens of dollars annually for what I can do
gratis.
