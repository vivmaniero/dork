#+TITLE: Dork

[[file:images/dork.jpg]]

This repository /currently/ acts as a backup for a [[file:dork.org][really neat org
table formula]] I wrote a little while ago, one that calculates the
total average of all your classes.

This is targeted towards users of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]].

Does that ring a bell? No, go on and check them out, they're very
powerful.

* Notice

[[file:dork.el][dork.el]] is pre-alpha software, it is under heavy development, and is
subject to change in significant ways - it is best you avoid using it,
unless you plan on giving me a hand in the design phase.

[[file:dork.org][dork.org]] will remain unaffected whilst I rewrite the relevant ~TBLFM~
in a more elegant and maintainable manner. Once I've achieved that,
the aforementioned ~TBLFM~ will transition into using internal
functions offered by dork.el.

* Questions No One Asked
** "Why not JavaScript?"
I've seen the solutions written by other students. They're mediocre,
to say the least. I've achieved with *one line* what they sought to
answer with fifty, all whilst preserving a copy of my grades offline.
** "Why not Excel?"
I tend to avoid heavy software such as the Microsoft Office suite.
Further, I just don't particularly enjoy investing time in learning
Microsoft's closed source technologies, nor do intend to shell out
tens of dollars annually for what I can do *gratis*.
